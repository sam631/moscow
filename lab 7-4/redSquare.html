Red Square lies in the heart og Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin, the exclusive GUM Department Store, State Historical Museum, and St. Basil's Cathedral- centers of government commerce, history and religion can all be found on each side.</p>
<p>Red Square lies along the Kremlin's north-east wall. It is defintely the most famous vision of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin has been the residence of the President of the Russian Federation and his Administation since 1992. For many years, the Kremlin was closed to only a select few, but in 1955 the museum located within the Kremlin walls became accessible to the public. The Kremlin has been and remains a unique monument of Russian culture and a symbol of Russian statehood.</p>
<p>The State Historical Museum stands at the western end of Red Square. The building is elaborately covered in ornate turnets, pinnacles anf decorative saw-tooth cornices. It museum was built between 1875 and 1881 by the architect V Sherwood. Within the museum are ancient artifacts dating from the prehistoric time up to the Russian Revolution.</p>
